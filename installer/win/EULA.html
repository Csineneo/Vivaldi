	<ol>2. Here at Vivaldi, we try to keep things as simple and easy as possible but since this is a legal document, it’s a bit
		longer than we would like it to be. It’s important that you read this carefully and understand the terms of use. By clicking
		through, you agree to the following terms and conditions. If you don’t agree to the following terms and conditions, you
		are not allowed to use Vivaldi Software or Services.</ol>

		a notice of such changes or by directly sending you a notification.</ol>

	<ol>4. This EULA does not apply to third party software or services that Vivaldi may deliver with Software or Services.
		Vivaldi assumes no responsibility or liability for such "Third Party Software or Services". Your use of such Third Party
		Software or Services is exclusively governed by the applicable end user license terms and conditions for such Third Party

		resell the Software or Services for any purpose, including without limitation any use in any application service provider
		environment, service bureau, or time-sharing arrangements</ol>

		of Norway, except its conflict of laws rules and regulations. All disputes, actions or proceedings arising under or related
		to this EULA shall exclusively be referred and resolved by the Oslo City Court. Notwithstanding, nothing in this EULA will
		be deemed as preventing Vivaldi from seeking injunctive relief (or any other provisional remedy) from any court having
		jurisdiction over the parties and the subject matter of the dispute as is necessary to protect Vivaldi's proprietary information,
		trade secrets, know-how, or any other intellectual property rights.</ol>
