// Manages the root scroller associated with a given document. The root
// scroller causes top controls movement, overscroll effects and prevents
// chaining scrolls up further in the DOM. It can be set from script using
// document.setRootScroller.
//
// There are two notions of a root scroller in this class: m_rootScroller and
// m_effectiveRootScroller. The former is the Element that was set as the root
// scroller using document.setRootScroller. If the page didn't set a root
// scroller this will be nullptr. The "effective" root scroller is the current
// element we're using internally to apply viewport scrolling actions.  The
// effective root scroller will only be null during document initialization.
// Both these elements come from this controller's associated Document. The
// final "global" root scroller, the one whose scrolling hides top controls,
// may be in a different frame.
//
// If the currently set m_rootScroller is a valid element to become the root
// scroller, it will be promoted to the effective root scroller. If it is not
// valid, the effective root scroller will fall back to a default Element (see
// defaultEffectiveRootScroller()). The rules for what makes an element a valid
// root scroller are set in isValidRootScroller(). The validity of the current
// root scroller is re-checked after each layout.
