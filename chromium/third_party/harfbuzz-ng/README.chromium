Description:
This is harfbuzz-ng, a new implementation of harfbuzz with a different
API from the old one.

This copy of harfbuzz is usually updated by downloading the release tarball
from http://www.freedesktop.org/software/harfbuzz/release/ , removing
files in src, copying *.h *.hh *.cc (except for hb-uniscribe*) from the
tarball's src folder over to src, then checking for removed or added files
and update our build recipes in BUILD.gn and harfbuzz.gyp accordingly, update
the NEWS file from HarfBuzz' release notes, and bump the version numbers
in README.chromium.

Local changes:
    * Custom revert: Change mark strategy back to UNICODE_LATE from
      GDEF_LATE for the default shaper - contributed by Behdad to unblock
      the HarfBuzz roll in Blink while the issue about broken quote glyphs
      in Times New Roman Italic can be resolved in upstream.
    * Upstream commit ebd7431f824
      "Partially revert 86c68c7a2c97"
      in order to fix mark positioning in
      fast/text/international/arabic-vertical-offset.html
    * Cherry-pick "Fix FixedVersion::to_int()"
