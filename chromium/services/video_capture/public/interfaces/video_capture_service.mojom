// Entry point to the Video Capture Service API.
// The service hosts three VideoCaptureDeviceFactories. The "regular" factory
// provides access to the capture devices connected to the system. The "fake"
// factory provides access to a single fake device that generates test frames.
// The "mock" factory provides access to a set of mock devices provided by the
// client, which are useful for verifying that the service implementation
// operates these devices correctly.
