// Translation creates two temporary files.  The first temporary file holds
// the object file created by llc.  The second holds the nexe produced by
// the linker.  Both of these temporary files are used to both write and
// read according to the following matrix:
//
// PnaclCoordinator::obj_file_:
//     written by: llc     (passed in explicitly through SRPC)
//     read by:    ld      (returned via lookup service from SRPC)
// PnaclCoordinator::nexe_file_:
//     written by: ld      (passed in explicitly through SRPC)
//     read by:    sel_ldr (passed in explicitly to command channel)
//

// TempFile represents a file used as a temporary between stages in
// translation.  It is automatically deleted when all handles are closed
// (or earlier -- immediately unlinked on POSIX systems).  The file is only
// opened, once, but because both reading and writing are necessary (and in
// different processes), the user should reset / seek back to the beginning
// of the file between sessions.
